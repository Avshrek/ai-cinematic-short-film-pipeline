## Description

*Half of Me* is a short cinematic film created using a multi-step AI-assisted
workflow that integrates narrative generation, voice synthesis, video generation,
and human-in-the-loop refinement.

The final output reflects the orchestration of multiple generative AI systems
combined with manual editing to ensure narrative coherence, emotional pacing,
and visual continuity.

## Narrative Overview

The film explores themes of split consciousness, identity dissolution, and
neuroscientific ethics through the story of two individuals connected by an
experimental neurological procedure.

Rather than focusing on realism, the visuals and narration emphasize symbolic
imagery, fragmented memory, and psychological tension.

## Production Breakdown

- **Story & Script:** Generated using large language models based on structured prompts
- **Voiceover:** AI-generated narration with dual voices representing fragmented identity
- **Video:** AI-generated cinematic clips aligned to scripted scenes
- **Editing & Refinement:** Human-in-the-loop trimming, sequencing, and synchronization
  performed using CapCut

## Notes on AI Usage

- No AI models were trained or modified during this project.
- All generative outputs were produced using existing AI tools.
- Human judgment was applied during selection, coordination, and final editing.

This output demonstrates practical understanding of AI system orchestration
rather than standalone content creation.
